abstract="This paper provides an introduction to the locally nameless approach to the representation of syntax with variable binding, focusing in particular on the use of this technique in formal proofs. First, we explain the benefits of representing bound variables with de Bruijn indices while retaining names for free variables. Then, we explain how to describe and manipulate syntax in that form, and show how to define and reason about judgments on locally nameless terms.",
